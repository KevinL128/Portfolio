# Portfolio Information

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio ! ðŸš€

Hi, I am Kevin! I am student in Business Insight and Analytics in Humber Polytechnic.
My passion for data analysis began during my university studies, where I was introduced to the potential of using data to solve business problems. I developed a strong interest in understanding patterns, trends and insight that help me for decision making. This curiosity inspired me to explore tools like Python, SQL and Power BI. Wanting to learn more and build a career in data analysis, I decided to pursuit my career in Humber Polytechnic.

Here, you will find a variety of projects showcasing my skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI. 

This reporsitory is organized into folders based on the tool used for each project. Below is an overview of the senctions:


1.	**Power BI Projects**

[**Supermarket Sales**](https://github.com/KevinL128/Portfolio/tree/main/Power%20BI%20Project)

**Description:** This project focused on analyzing a supermarket sales data using Power BI. The data set includes, Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer type, Gender, Product Line, Unit Price, Quantity, Tax 5%, Total, Date, Time, Payment, COGS, Gross margin, Gross income and Rating. Using this dataset, I created interactive dashboards, performed data analysis, and implemented DAX calculations.

**Skills demonstrated:** Data visualization, DAX calculations, Data analysis, Data integration.

2. **SQL Projects**
   
[**Retail Sales**](https://github.com/KevinL128/Portfolio/tree/main/SQL%20Project)

**Description:** This project I used SQL to perform data analysis on Retail Sales data. The data set includes, Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, Total Amount. I identified top-performing products categories and high-value customers, analyzed average age of customer, evaluated gender distribution, calculated average order value (AOV), identified the day of the week with the highest sales volume, which provided valuable information for strategic decision-making.

**Skills demonstraded:** Data Aggregation and Grouping, Sorting, Window Functions, Date and Time Functions, Data manipulation, Descriptive Analysis.

   
3. **Python Projects**
   
[**Admission Department Program of Humber Polytechnic**](https://github.com/KevinL128/Portfolio/tree/main/Python%20Project)

**Description:** This project I utilized Python to develop a program capable of managing student data efficiently. This involved input handling, loops, conditional logic, and list manipulation. I performed testing and debugging to ensure the program correctly handled both valid and invalid inputs. The program allowed for easy storage and manipulation of students names, making it a practical tool for admission-related tasks.

**Skills demonstraded:** Input, Loops, Conditionals, Debugging, Problem-Solving, Data management and manipulation.
